Weak convergence of the FMadogram estimator in presence of missing data.

Simulations to observe the behaviour of this estimator.

Updates :
--------

[x] Compute the variance of the gaussian process limit considering a FMadogram and independent copula (equal to 1/90).
[x] Generalize it with the lambda Madogram and independent copula
[x] Do the computation for the brownian bridge with missing data
[x] Consider other copula which are tractable to compute

1 - Update 27 / 05 / 2021 10 : 32

For the second bullet, the variance of the lambda Madogram take the closed form of :

g(x) = ((x^2)*(1-x)^2 / (1+x*(1-x))^2)) * ( 1 / (1+2*x*(1-x)) - (1-x) / (1 + x + 2*x*(1-x)) - x / (2 - x + 2*x*(1-x)))

where x is between 0 and 1.

Simulations have been added with lambda = 0.1, we plot the density as n (length of the sample) increase and added the density of the gaussian with
parameters 0 and g(0.1).

2 - Update 28 / 05 / 2021 9 : 22

Modifying latex (typos) and add some lines to detail the structure of the variance of the limiting process.

3 - Update 31 / 05 / 2021 17 : 26

Computations were done with missing data. Theory seems to not follow the results obtained by simulation... (especially for small value of lambda)

Notwithstanding, code was entirely reworked and a lot errors were handled. Theory was also reworked but no error was seen (i'm gonna write the proof clearly
hence you might be able to point out some theoretical error).

I'm starting the computations for extreme value copula, I can handle some computation easily but some might be harder.

4 - Update 02 / 06 / 2021 8 : 18

Add lemma in order to prove the functional integral that should satisfies each bounded measurable function with respect to a bounded variation function of the type
|x^\lambda - y^{1-\lambda}|.
We can prove, using the same tools, that the normalized estimator proposed in Naveau 2009 does not modify the variance of the limiting gaussian process.

5 - Update 08 / 08 / 2021 16 : 16

Code is now written in R. The same problem persist with n range from 2 to 1024. (see outputvar_lambda.pnh and outputvar_lambda_miss.png)
It works well without missing data but does not fit with missing data, as in python.

5 - Update 08 / 08 / 2021 16 : 42

Add some elements to compute covariance of the limiting process of Segers (2014).

6 - Update 11 / 06 / 2021 17:00 

Add a proof to show that my results were false on the convergence of the lambda FMadogram estimated
with missing data to a gaussian law with a certain variance (i'm still not sure about that). We can
see that remark 4 in Derumigny and Fermanian conditional empirical copula process (2020).

Compute a lower and an upper bound to the hard integral (12) the pdf.

7 - Update 14 / 06 / 2021 18 : 20

Add constant for variance of the lambda FMadogram when we consider an extreme value copula. I have bounded below the covariance (see the remark on the pdf).
I wasn't able to find an upper bound more beautiful. The constant are not really stylish, nevertheless, we (maybe) make them more beautiful at the cost of losing
precision.
Indeed, all the results are true until I found a mistake.
