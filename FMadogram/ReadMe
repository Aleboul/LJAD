Weak convergence of the FMadogram estimator in presence of missing data.

Simulations to observe the behaviour of this estimator.

Update :
--------

[x] Compute the variance of the gaussian process limit considering a FMadogram and independent copula (equal to 1/90).
[x] Generalize it with the lambda Madogram and independent copula
[ ] Do the computation for the brownian bridge with missing data
[ ] Consider other copula which are tractable to compute

For the second bullet, the variance of the lambda Madogram take the closed form of :

g(x) = ((x^2)*(1-x)^2 / (1+x*(1-x))^2)) * ( 1 / (1+2*x*(1-x) - (1-x) / (1 + x + 2*x*(1-x)) - x / (2 - x + 2*x*(1-x)))

where x is between 0 and 1.
