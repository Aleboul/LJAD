Weak convergence of the FMadogram estimator in presence of missing data.

Simulations to observe the behaviour of this estimator.

Updates :
--------

[x] Compute the variance of the gaussian process limit considering a FMadogram and independent copula (equal to 1/90).
[x] Generalize it with the lambda Madogram and independent copula
[ ] Do the computation for the brownian bridge with missing data
[ ] Consider other copula which are tractable to compute

1 - Update 27 / 05 / 2021 10 : 32

For the second bullet, the variance of the lambda Madogram take the closed form of :

g(x) = ((x^2)*(1-x)^2 / (1+x*(1-x))^2)) * ( 1 / (1+2*x*(1-x)) - (1-x) / (1 + x + 2*x*(1-x)) - x / (2 - x + 2*x*(1-x)))

where x is between 0 and 1.

Simulations have been added with lambda = 0.1, we plot the density as n (length of the sample) increase and added the density of the gaussian with
parameters 0 and g(0.1).

2 - Update 28 / 05 / 2021 9 : 22

Modifying latex (typos) and add some lines to detail the structure of the variance of the limiting process.
