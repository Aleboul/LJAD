Weak convergence of the FMadogram estimator in presence of missing data.

Simulations to observe the behaviour of this estimator.

Updates :
--------

[x] Compute the variance of the gaussian process limit considering a FMadogram and independent copula (equal to 1/90).
[x] Generalize it with the lambda Madogram and independent copula
[x] Do the computation for the brownian bridge with missing data
[ ] Consider other copula which are tractable to compute

1 - Update 27 / 05 / 2021 10 : 32

For the second bullet, the variance of the lambda Madogram take the closed form of :

g(x) = ((x^2)*(1-x)^2 / (1+x*(1-x))^2)) * ( 1 / (1+2*x*(1-x)) - (1-x) / (1 + x + 2*x*(1-x)) - x / (2 - x + 2*x*(1-x)))

where x is between 0 and 1.

Simulations have been added with lambda = 0.1, we plot the density as n (length of the sample) increase and added the density of the gaussian with
parameters 0 and g(0.1).

2 - Update 28 / 05 / 2021 9 : 22

Modifying latex (typos) and add some lines to detail the structure of the variance of the limiting process.

3 - Update 31 / 05 / 2021 17 : 26

Computations were done with missing data. Theory seems to not follow the results obtained by simulation... (especially for small value of lambda)

Notwithstanding, code was entirely reworked and a lot errors were handled. Theory was also reworked but no error was seen (i'm gonna write the proof clearly
hence you might be able to point out some theoretical error).

I'm starting the computations for extreme value copula, I can handle some computation easily but some might be harder.
