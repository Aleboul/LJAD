Weak convergence of the FMadogram estimator in presence of missing data.

Simulations to observe the behaviour of this estimator.

Update :
--------

[x] Compute the variance of the gaussian process limit considering a FMadogram and independent copula (equal to 1/90).
[ ] Generalize it with the lambda Madogram and independent copula
[ ] Do the computation for the brownian bridge with missing data
[ ] Consider other copula which are tractable to compute
